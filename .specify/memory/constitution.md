# Research Paper Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
All claims must be verified with primary or authoritative sources. Every statement requires robust evidential support.

### II. Clarity
Content must maintain an academic tone suitable for computer science and artificial intelligence researchers. Technical concepts must be articulated precisely and unambiguously.

### III. Reproducibility
Every claim, result, and conclusion must be traceable, citable, and evidence-based. Experimental setups and data analysis methodologies must be described in sufficient detail to allow for independent replication.

### IV. Rigor
The highest priority must be given to peer-reviewed scientific literature as foundational evidence. Reliance on anecdotal or unverified sources is prohibited.

## Standards

### Citations
All citations must adhere strictly to the APA 7th edition format. In-text citations and reference lists must conform to this style guide.

### Sources
A minimum of 15 distinct sources is required, with at least 50% derived from peer-reviewed academic publications. Diverse and authoritative sources must be utilized.

### Evidence
No unsupported statements are permitted. All assertions must be directly backed by verifiable evidence. The fabrication or invention of citations or data is strictly prohibited.

### Originality
A zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism is enforced. All submitted content must be original, with proper attribution given to all external ideas, data, and text.

### Writing
The prose must be clear, formal, and maintain a readability level appropriate for grade 10–12 academic audiences. Grammatical correctness and stylistic consistency are mandatory.

## Constraints

### Word Count
The final document must fall within a range of 5,000 to 7,000 words. Strict adherence to this limitation is required to ensure conciseness and focus.

### Verification
All factual claims and data points must be cross-checked against multiple reputable and authoritative sources to ensure absolute accuracy.

### Format
The final output must be a PDF document, complete with embedded citations and a comprehensive reference list.

### Time/Token Efficiency
Verbose or redundant text must be avoided. Content generation must prioritize precision and information density to maximize efficiency.

## Governance

### AI Behavioral Rules
1. Reject unverifiable information: The AI must never incorporate information that cannot be traced to an authoritative source.
2. Never fabricate data, quotes, or citations: All generated content must be truthful and accurately attributed.
3. Maintain strict academia-level neutrality: Output must be objective, unbiased, and free from personal opinions or emotional language.
4. Prioritize peer-reviewed evidence: In cases of conflicting information, peer-reviewed scientific literature holds precedence.
5. Keep outputs concise, accurate, and structured: Responses must be efficient, factually correct, and logically organized.

### Success Criteria
1. All claims verified and traceable: Every assertion in the document must be directly supported by evidence.
2. Zero plagiarism or hallucinated references: The document must be free from any instances of unoriginal content or invented sources.
3. Meets academic quality and clarity standards: The overall quality, presentation, and comprehensibility must satisfy academic benchmarks.
4. Arguments show depth, technical accuracy, and coherence: The reasoning presented must be sound, technically precise, and logically connected.
5. Ready for academic review: The document must be prepared to withstand scrutiny from academic peers.

### Completion Definition
A 5,000–7,000 word academically rigorous, APA-cited, plagiarism-free PDF research paper on AI-native software development that passes fact-checking and meets academic standards.
