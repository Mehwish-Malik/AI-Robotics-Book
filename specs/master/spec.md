# Feature Specification: Humanoid AI Robotics Book Blueprint

## Overview
Create a complete book blueprint for Humanoid AI Robotics with modules, chapters, subtopics, diagrams, learning goals, case studies, technical depth, and a Docusaurus documentation plan.

## Primary Requirement
Develop a comprehensive book blueprint that covers humanoid AI robotics from fundamentals to advanced implementations, including real-world examples, coding examples, and documentation ready for Docusaurus deployment.

## Technical Approach
- Create 12-18 chapters grouped into logical modules
- Include real-world examples from Tesla Optimus, Atlas, Figure AI
- Provide coding examples and technical depth
- Design Docusaurus documentation structure with MDX layout
- Include deployment strategy for the documentation website

## Functional Requirements
1. Book structure with modules and chapters
2. Technical content covering robotics, AI, and control systems
3. Docusaurus documentation plan with folder structure
4. MDX layout and sidebar configuration
5. Deployment strategy for documentation website
6. Learning goals and case studies for each module
7. Diagrams and visual aids planning

## Non-functional Requirements
- Professional, modern, technically rich content
- Ready for development as full documentation website
- Organized for easy navigation and learning
- Include both theoretical concepts and practical implementations
