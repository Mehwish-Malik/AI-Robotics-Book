# Humanoid AI Robotics Book Blueprint - Plan Creation

## PROMPT_TEXT
Create a complete book blueprint for Humanoid AI Robotics. Provide modules, chapters, subtopics, diagrams, learning goals, case studies, technical depth, and a Docusaurus documentation plan with folder structure, MDX layout, sidebar config, and deployment strategy. Make the book professional, modern, technically rich, and ready for development as a full documentation website. Include 10–12 chapters grouped into modules, use real-world examples (Tesla Optimus, Atlas, Figure AI), give coding examples, and produce a clean final outline that looks like a publish-ready specification

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Successfully created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Humanoid AI Robotics book blueprint, including:

1. Feature specification document (spec.md)
2. Implementation plan with technical context (plan.md)
3. Research findings resolving all clarifications (research.md)
4. Data models for content management (data-model.md)
5. Quickstart guide for contributors (quickstart.md)
6. API contracts for content management (contracts/content-api.yaml)
7. Complete Docusaurus documentation plan (docusaurus-plan.md)
8. Detailed book blueprint with 16 chapters across 5 modules (book-blueprint.md)
9. Implementation tasks breakdown (tasks.md)

The blueprint includes 16 chapters organized into 5 modules covering Foundation & Principles, Hardware Systems, Control Systems, AI & Perception, and Applications & Integration. Each chapter includes learning goals, subtopics, technical depth, diagrams, code examples, and case study integration. The Docusaurus plan includes folder structure, MDX layout, sidebar configuration, and deployment strategy.

## OUTCOME
Plan successfully created with all required components for developing a professional, modern, and technically rich book on Humanoid AI Robotics as a Docusaurus documentation website.

## EVALUATION
All requirements from the user prompt have been addressed: modules and chapters defined (16 chapters in 5 modules), subtopics specified for each chapter, diagrams planned, learning goals established, case studies included (Tesla Optimus, Atlas, Figure AI), technical depth provided, Docusaurus documentation plan created with folder structure, MDX layout, sidebar config, and deployment strategy.
