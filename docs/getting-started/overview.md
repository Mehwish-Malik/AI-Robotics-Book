# Getting Started Overview

This section provides an introduction to the Humanoid AI Robotics book and guidance on how to navigate and utilize the content effectively.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into five interconnected modules that progressively build your understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **Foundation & Principles** - Core concepts and historical context
2. **Hardware Systems** - Physical components and their integration
3. **Control Systems** - Algorithms and mechanisms for robot control
4. **AI & Perception** - Intelligence and sensory processing systems
5. **Applications & Integration** - Real-world deployment and future directions

## Learning Path Options

### Option 1: Sequential Learning
Read the book from beginning to end for a comprehensive understanding. This approach is recommended for readers new to robotics or those seeking a thorough foundation.

### Option 2: Modular Learning
Focus on specific modules based on your current needs or interests:
- Engineers working on hardware: Modules 1, 2, and 3
- AI/ML practitioners: Modules 1, 4, and 5
- Researchers: All modules with emphasis on Modules 4 and 5
- Business professionals: Module 5 with selected content from other modules

## Technical Prerequisites

To fully benefit from this book, you should have:
- Basic understanding of mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, probability)
- Programming experience in Python or C++
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Code Examples

Throughout the book, you'll find code examples in multiple languages:
- **Python**: For AI, machine learning, and high-level control
- **C++**: For performance-critical real-time systems
- **ROS**: For robotics middleware and communication

All code examples are designed to be educational and practical, with clear explanations of implementation details.

## Notation and Conventions

- Mathematical notation follows standard robotics literature
- Key terms are highlighted and defined when first introduced
- Code blocks include syntax highlighting for readability
- Figures and diagrams illustrate complex concepts visually
- Cross-references connect related topics across chapters

## Additional Resources

- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples from Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas, and Figure AI
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for practical implementation
- **Reference Materials**: Technical specifications and API documentation
- **Exercises**: Practical challenges to reinforce learning

## Navigation Tips

Use the sidebar to navigate between modules and chapters. Each chapter includes:
- Learning objectives at the beginning
- Key concepts highlighted throughout
- Summary of main points at the end
- References for further reading
- Exercises for practical application
